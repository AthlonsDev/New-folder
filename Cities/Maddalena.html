            <h1>History</h1>
            <h3>
                The Maddalena Archipelago is a group of islands in the Strait of Bonifacio between Corsica (France) and
                north-eastern Sardinia (Italy). The whole archipelago makes the territory of the La Maddalena comune in
                Sardinia.
                The islands have been inhabited since prehistoric times. They were known by the Romans as Cunicularia
                and were a busy shipping area during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. The Maddalenas have a strategic value
                and were the object of a dispute between the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa in the 13th century
                and subsequently were abandoned for a long period before being colonised again by Corsican shepherds and
                by Sardinian settlements in the 18th century. Napoleon Bonaparte, Admiral Nelson and Giuseppe Garibaldi
                all have historical links with the area.
                <br>
                The main access into and out of the archipelago is via the frequent car ferries from Palau on Sardinia
                that run into La Maddalena. There are roads only on Maddalena and Caprera.
                <br>
                From 1973 until 2008 the Santo Stefano island was a home for the NATO naval base which housed US nuclear
                submarines. Controversy arose in 2003 when the USS Hartford ran aground in the vicinity of the
                Bisce Island while on maneuvers in the area.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Lying adjacent to the tourist resort of the Costa Smeralda, Maddalena has the same clear waters and wind
                blown granite coastlines but remains a haven for wildlife. It is a designated national park, the Parco
                Nazionale Arcipelago di La Maddalena. It is a popular tourist destination especially among boaters. In
                2006 it was placed on the tentative list for consideration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
