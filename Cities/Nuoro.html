            <h1>History</h1>
            <h3 id="firstParagraph">
                Birthplace of several renowned artists, including writers, poets, painters, sculptors, Nuoro hosts some
                of the most important museums in Sardinia. It is considered an important cultural center of the
                region and it has been referred to as the "Sardinian Athens". Nuoro is the hometown of Grazia
                Deledda, the only Italian woman to win (1926) the Nobel Prize in Literature.</h3>

            <h3 id="more">The Nuorese was a centre of the Nuragic civilization (which developed in Sardinia from c. 1500
                BC to c.
                250 BC), as attested by more than 30 Nuragic sites, such has the village discovered in the countryside
                of Tanca Manna, just outside Nuoro, which was made of about 800 huts.

                The Nuorese was crossed by a Roman road which connected Karalis (Cagliari) to Ulbia (Olbia). The legacy
                of the Roman colonization can especially be found in the variety of the Sardinian language which is
                still spoken today in Nuoro: Nuorese Sardinian is considered the most conservative dialect of Sardinian,
                which is in turn the most conservative Romance language.
                <br>
                The centre of Sardinia, the island’s heart, is a stranger to the rhythms of the coast. A mountain
                scenery rich in forests, waterfalls and rivers in a breathtaking natural setting characterize this area.

                Here reign special flavours, from the richness of the forests and the farms in the area. Mountain
                charcuterie, roast meats, cheeses, chestnuts and hazelnuts, predominate over a table enriched by the
                typical carasau bread and accompanied by a glass of good Cannonau wine.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here people live better and longer; the recipe for the “elixir” of long life is simple: fresh air, good
                food, a natural lifestyle and a vibrant social life that animates these mountains.
                A trip to Sardinia’s interior is like diving into the ancient world of the island, where traditions
                testify to the deep roots of the Sardinian culture and the unique hospitality of the people who live
                there.
                Each season has its charm.
