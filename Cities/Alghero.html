            <h1>History</h1>
            <h3>The History of [city] goes back and bla bla bla...
                Historically, the city was founded in the early twelfth century between 1102 and 1112,
                when the noble Doria family of Genoa was allowed to build the first historical nucleus
                into an empty section of the coast of the parish of Nulauro in Judicature of Torres (Sassari).
                For two centuries it remained in the orbit of the Maritime Republics,
                first and foremost the Genoese, apart from 1283 to 1284 when the Pisans were able to control
                it for a year. It is plausible that at this time the town shared, given its commercial and
                multi-ethnic nature, a language similar to the nascent Sassarese.
                The village was conquered by force by the Crown of Aragon, at the behest of King Pere IV of Aragon
                (r. 1336â€“1387), who later actively promoted colonisation of the town and the surrounding area,
                sending numerous families from different counties and provinces of the then Crown of Aragon,
                including Valencia, Majorca, Catalonia and Aragon. These were granted enticing privileges and, in fact,
                replaced the original population, some of whom were sent to the Iberian Peninsula and Majorca as
                slaves.[5] The dialects these families spoke in Alghero were all very similar and derived from the same
                linguistic family. Over time, it settled on its current form of Catalan, despite the subsequent decline
                of the Crown of Aragon.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The population is noted for having retained the language of the Catalan conquerors from the end of the
                Middle Ages, when Sardinia was part of the Crown of Aragon; hence, Alguerese (the Catalan dialect spoken
                there) is officially recognized as a minority language.
